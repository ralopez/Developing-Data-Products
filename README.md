# Developing-Data-Products
This app was done as part of the final project for the course Developing Data Products.
The user chooses any two (non-vertical) lines by enetering their y-intercepts and their slopes. 
Then, the app finds their intersection point.  
If the two lines are the same it yields the message "Both Lines are the same". 
If the two lines are different but parallel, the app yields the message "Both lines are parallel".
The app also draws the two lines in the selected xy intervals
